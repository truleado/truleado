   - Mention relevant features or benefits from the product that address those challenges
   - Offer genuine value or insights, not just promotion
   - Be conversational and helpful, like a knowledgeable peer
   - Include a subtle mention of how the product could help (without being pushy)
   - Use specific product features/benefits that match the user's needs
3. A quality score from 1-10 (10 being perfect fit)
4. Confidence level from 1-10

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "reasons": ["reason1", "reason2", "reason3"],
  "sampleReply": "Your helpful reply here...",
  "qualityScore": 8,
  "confidence": 7
}

Focus on:
- Specific pain points or needs mentioned
- Buying intent signals
- Authority and engagement level
- Relevance to your product
