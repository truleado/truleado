# 🚀 Improved AI-Powered Search Term Generation

## What Changed

### ❌ **Old System (Basic)**
```javascript
// Simple keyword extraction
const searchTerms = [
  product.name,                    // "Bullhorn"
  ...description.split(' ').slice(0, 5),  // "Leading", "provider", "cloud-based"
  ...features.slice(0, 3),        // "Applicant Tracking System (ATS)"
  ...benefits.slice(0, 3)         // "Streamline recruitment process"
]
```

**Problems:**
- Generic marketing words ("Leading", "provider", "cloud-based")
- Feature-focused instead of problem-focused
- No understanding of how people actually talk
- Limited to 11 basic terms

### ✅ **New System (AI-Powered)**
```javascript
// AI generates 6 categories of targeted search terms
const searchStrategy = await aiSearchGenerator.generateSearchTerms(productData)

const allSearchTerms = [
  ...searchStrategy.problemTerms,      // 8 terms - pain points people discuss
  ...searchStrategy.solutionTerms,     // 8 terms - solutions people seek
  ...searchStrategy.industryTerms,     // 6 terms - industry jargon
  ...searchStrategy.conversationTerms, // 6 terms - help-seeking phrases
  ...searchStrategy.urgencyTerms,      // 4 terms - immediate need indicators
  ...searchStrategy.toolTerms          // 6 terms - competitor names & tool categories
]
```
